This project utilizes an ice40HX1K FPGA board which features 4 push buttons, 4 LEDs, 2 digit 7 segment display, and a PMOD port. The 1st and 2nd pushbutton are used to toggle and select digits 0-9, and the 3rd pushbutton is used to select the digit. There are 4 LEDs on the board which allow the user to know what digit they are on. After 4 digits have been selected, the LEDs will flash and a Y or N will be shown on the 7 Segment display. When a correct passcode has been selected a servo will rotate to an open position, the default and incorrect passcode sequence will keep the servo in a a closed position.
